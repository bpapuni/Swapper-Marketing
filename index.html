                <h1>Collection Swap</h1>
                <p>Collection Swap is a 2023 capstone project for our client, Robert Sutcliffe, a senior lecturer at WelTec. The project involved the development of a web application designed to streamline the exchange of collectibles among users.</p> 
                <p>Focusing on the safety and well-being of children, Robert envisioned an online platform where young collectors could securely trade their items in a transparent and secure environment.</p>
                <p>After 13 weeks, our team developed <em>“Swapper”</em> - a safe and community-oriented collectibles trading platform. Swapper is designed to assist users with exchanging items and completing their collections. Moreover, users can effortlessly swap collectibles without the need for face-to-face interactions, making the process smooth, and hassle-free. </p>
                <p> We developed key features, such as the capability to perform multiple swaps simultaneously, a comprehensive swap history for tracking past and ongoing swaps, and the ability for users to provide feedback once a swap is successfully completed. These features were instrumental in delivering the complete Swapper website as envisioned by our client.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>To create a system that empowers users to manage their collections and facilitate item swaps, our development team put into practice a diverse set of technical skills acquired during our enrolment at WelTec. We effectively utilized the Entity Framework's code-first approach to define a database structure through code, creating model classes for user collections, swap records, and feedback data. </p>
                    <p>We implemented a robust matching system designed to connect users seeking items from each other's collections. The core of this matching system involves the analysis of user collections. We serialize each user's collection into a JSON format, allowing for easy comparison and identification of duplicate and missing items. Our algorithm inspects the contents of these JSON collections, identifying items that are duplicates for one user while fulfilling a need for another. This streamlined process seamlessly connects potential swap partners based on their specific item requirements.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we employed AJAX-based page navigation and history management to create dynamic, responsive web pages that display potential swaps, track swap progress, and showcase user feedback, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. Our commitment to user-centric design has allowed us to create interfaces that are both visually appealing and user-friendly. </p>
                    <p>Moreover, the system's database management capabilities allow a system admin to seamlessly incorporate new collections and sponsor information into the system. These collective technical skills have culminated in a secure, user-friendly, and efficiently managed system that emphasizes children's safety and supports contactless swaps, showcasing our readiness to provide real-world IT solutions.</p>
